## Getting Started

To run the project on your local machine for development and testing purposes, follow the instructions below.

### Prerequisites

You will need the following software installed on your machine:

- React with TypeScript
- npm (Node Package Manager)
- Vite

### Installing

Follow these steps to set up your development environment:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone http://example.com/your-repo.git
   cd your-repo
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

### Running the tests

To run the automated tests for this project, use the following commands:

#### End-to-End Tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```bash
npm run test:e2e
```

#### Coding Style Tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```bash
npm run lint
```

## Deployment

To deploy this project on a live system, follow these steps:

1. Build the project:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

2. Deploy the contents of the `dist` directory to your web server.

## Built With

* [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) - The build tool used
* [React](https://reactjs.org/) - The web framework used
* [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) - Language used for development
* [Material-UI](https://mui.com/) - UI framework used for styling
* [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/) - Used for routing

## Sources Used

### BlogPage.tsx

*Lines 46 - 51*

```typescript
const handleInputChange = (e: React.ChangeEvent<HTMLInputElement | HTMLTextAreaElement>) => {
  const { name, value } = e.target;
  setCommentData({ ...commentData, [name]: value });
};
```

The code above was adapted from [React documentation](https://reactjs.org/docs/forms.html) as shown below:

```typescript
const handleInputChange = (event) => {
  const target = event.target;
  const value = target.type === 'checkbox' ? target.checked : target.value;
  const name = target.name;

  this.setState({
    [name]: value
  });
}
```

- **How**: The code in the React documentation was adapted to use functional components and hooks instead of class components and state.
- **Why**: The code was used to handle form input changes in a functional component using hooks, which is the recommended approach in modern React development.
- **How**: The code was modified to use the `useState` hook for state management and TypeScript for type safety.

## Artificial Intelligence Tools Used

* [ChatGPT](https://www.openai.com/) - AI tool used for generating and refining code snippets.

### Prompt Used on ChatGPT

```
How do I handle form input changes in a React functional component using hooks?
```

The code prompt above was used [ChatGPT](https://www.openai.com/) to generate the code shown below:

```typescript
const handleInputChange = (e: React.ChangeEvent<HTMLInputElement | HTMLTextAreaElement>) => {
  const { name, value } = e.target;
  setCommentData({ ...commentData, [name]: value });
};
```

#### File Name
*Lines 46 - 51*

```typescript
const handleInputChange = (e: React.ChangeEvent<HTMLInputElement | HTMLTextAreaElement>) => {
  const { name, value } = e.target;
  setCommentData({ ...commentData, [name]: value });
};
```

- **How**: The code generated by ChatGPT was implemented by replacing the class component approach with a functional component approach.
- **Why**: ChatGPT's code was used because it provided a clear and concise way to handle form input changes using modern React practices.
- **How**: The code was modified to include TypeScript type annotations for better type safety and error checking.
